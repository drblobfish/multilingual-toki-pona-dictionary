Huge thank you to all the contributors of lipu lili pona, especially [jan Ne](https://github.com/jan-Ne). They did all the hard work ; here I just put together some python scripts to parse their work and tidy it into neater files for programmers.

## toki pona

> Toki Pona is a philosophical artistic constructed language (philosophical artlang) known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition. [...] Toki Pona is an isolating language with only 14 phonemes and an underlying feature of minimalism. It focuses on simple, near-universal concepts to maximize expression from very few words. The Toki Pona Dictionary lists 137 "essential" words and a number of less-used ones.
